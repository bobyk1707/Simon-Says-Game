# Simon Says Game

## Project Overview
The **Simon Says Game** is a simple yet interactive web-based memory game where players need to remember and replicate a sequence of lights and sounds. The game becomes progressively more challenging as the sequence gets longer after each successful turn.

This project is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to provide an enjoyable user experience with a clean design and dynamic interactivity.

## Features
- **Start Game**: The game begins with a random light and sound sequence.
- **Colorful Interface**: The interface has four colored buttons, each representing a unique sound.
- **Increasing Difficulty**: Each round, the sequence grows longer, adding more complexity for the player.
- **User Interaction**: Players click the colored buttons to repeat the sequence shown.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is playable on all screen sizes, from desktop to mobile.
- **Game Over Notification**: If the player selects the wrong sequence, the game displays a "Game Over" message.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For creating the structure of the game.
- **CSS3**: For designing a visually appealing and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript**: For handling the game logic, button interactions, sequences, and sound effects.

## How to Play
1. Press the "Start" button to begin the game.
2. Watch the sequence of colors light up.
3. Use your mouse or touchpad to replicate the exact sequence.
4. Each time you complete a sequence correctly, the game adds a new color to the sequence.
5. If you press a wrong color, the game ends, and you will have the option to start over.
